# Contributions
Hello and thank you for being willing to contribute! The scope of this project is pretty narrow as it has a very narrow requirements but I'm always willing to hear interesting ideas! If you have an idea or find a bug, please log an issue.

Also, part of this project is to work on my budding rust skills so the code is likely horrible rust code. If you have rust experience or have developed a lot in rust, please leave an issue with recommendations. Thanks!
